## Why use this version? Why not use the one from flyduino?

The version on the flyduino page is very basic. Some people like that. This one can do more:

* Displays statistics when you land (such as max amps, max watts, max RPM, etc.)
* You can make the OSD more or less busy with information using a digital volume (DV) dial on your radio
* You can set a battery low warning which will tell you at which mAh value you should land. You can set the value with a DV on your radio. It will be stored on the OSD and it will use the same value next time it gets plugged in.

## When should you not use this version?

* You do not use KISS 24RE ESCs
* Your radio does not have any digital volume control
